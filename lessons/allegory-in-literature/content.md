### Examine an allegory on Climate Change

* Direct your students to read the fairy tale closely and allow enough time for them to make notes about its allegorical elements.
* Use the notes to initiate a classroom discussion on different aspects of the story.
* Ask your students to draw parallels between the fairy tale narrative and the real-world scenario by listing all the perceived elements of climate change in the text eg. rising sea-levels, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather events.
* Finally, facilitate a classroom discussion using the following list of questions to assess student understanding of allegory as a literary device for communicating climate change.
