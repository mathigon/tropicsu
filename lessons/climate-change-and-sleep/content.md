# Impact of Climate Change on Circadian Rhythms and Sleep

## Overview
> section: overview

::: .teaching-notes
As a High School Biological Sciences or Environmental Sciences or Health Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about circadian rhythms and the factors involved in maintaining the circadian rhythm in all living organisms.  
:::

This lesson plan will discuss the impact of global warming on sleep in humans, which is as an integral part of their circadian rhythm.

This lesson plan will teach students about circadian rhythms and how they are important for the health and well-being of all living beings. Global warming is potentially causing a change in day and nighttime temperatures.

This lesson plan includes resources to show how sleep is affected by higher nighttime temperatures and therefore, could lead to adverse impacts on human health due to a disruption in the circadian rhythm.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Biological Sciences or Environmental Sciences or Health Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High School

__Discipline__: Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences,Health Sciences  

__Topics__: Circadian Rhythm, Biological Rhythms, Biological Clock, Photosensitive Ganglion Cells, Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), Sleep Disruption, Sleep Deprivation, Light Sensitivity, Body temperature  

__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Anthroposphere, Climate and the Biosphere

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

1. Explain what circadian rhythms in living beings are and what influences them
1. Discuss the correlation of circadian rhythm and sleep cycles
1. Describe the importance of sleep cycles for the health and well-being of individuals
1. Explain how global warming could cause sleep deprivation and disruptions in humans

## What Makes You Tick?
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 3 min

::: .teaching-notes
A short video micro-lecture that introduces circadian rhythms and explains why it is important for living beings.
:::

Watch this video micro-lecture, ‘What Makes You Tick: Circadian Rhythms’ by Oxford Sparks, Oxford University, to introduce the topic of circadian rhythms.

* Use this tool to explain why circadian rhythms are important for all livings beings.
* Describe the role of photosensitive ganglion cells in the eye and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the brain, in managing the circadian rhythm.
* Explain that maintenance of the circadian rhythm in individuals depends on environmental cues such as light and that any disruptions can be detrimental to their health.

## Circadian Rhythms
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
A factsheet that defines circadian rhythm and explains its importance in influencing the physiology and behavior of humans. This tool is also available in Spanish.
:::

* Use this factsheet, ‘Circadian Rhythms’ by National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to further your students’ understanding of circadian rhythms. This tool is also available in Spanish.
* Use the text to differentiate between circadian rhythms and biological clocks.
* Define what is the master clock of the body and explain how it is responsible for keeping the circadian rhythm in sync with body physiology and behavior.
* Explain that circadian rhythms are influenced by both natural (genetic) and environmental cues such as daylight and in turn are responsible for body function and health.
* Use the text to explain how the body’s master clock is responsible for establishing sleep patterns in individuals.
* Finally, discuss how disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to health problems.

## Global Warming & Sleepless Nights
> section: Video
> format: Video
> duration: 5-7 min

::: .teaching-notes
A video that describes a study about sleep disruptions in individuals in the USA because of higher nighttime temperatures due to global warming.
:::

Watch this video about Scientists warn of sleepless nights in a warming world’ by Ryan Cross, published in Science, to describe the effect of temperature on sleep cycles in individuals in the United States..

## Biological Rhythms
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 1-2 days

::: .teaching-notes
A set of classroom or laboratory activities to explore biological rhythms in living organisms.
:::

* Use the set of activities, ‘Biological Rhythms’ by University of Washington, to enable students to explore their own biological rhythms in an engaging manner.
* In the context of this lesson plan, direct your students to follow the instructions for ‘Experiment 1: The Ups and Downs of Body Temperature’ to investigate the body temperature rhythm.
* Ask your students to do an additional activity from the ‘reaction time’ set of experiments for the same time-points.
* Use the data collected to correlate the body temperature noted at specific time-points and the corresponding reaction times.
* Use the correlation, if any, to discuss how warmer temperatures due to global warming could in turn affect body temperature related reaction times and therefore, biological rhythms in individuals.
