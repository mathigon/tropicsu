description: A video micro-lecture that discusses Earth’s energy balance and the
  greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will learn how to determine the surface temperature of planet Earth
  with no atmosphere and with 1- and 2-layer atmosphere. They will also
  understand the greenhouse effect of the Earth’s atmosphere.

  Use this tool to help students find answers to:

  1. Why does the surface temperature of Earth increase due to the greenhouse
     effect of the Earth’s atmosphere?
  2. What is the energy budget of a bare blackbody Earth and of Earth with an
     atmosphere?
