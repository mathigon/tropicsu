description: A classroom/laboratory activity to learn about the pH of ocean
  water, explore the potential effects of climate change on ocean acidification,
  and understand the possible impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms
  such as oysters.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will explore and analyze the relationship between the growth of
  oyster larvae and the chemistry of ocean water (aragonite saturation state) by
  plotting graphs for actual data from the Whiskey Creek Hatchery in Oregon, USA.

  Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

  1. If ocean water became more acidic, how might it affect oyster populations?
  2. What are the possible impacts of climate change on the chemistry of seawater?
